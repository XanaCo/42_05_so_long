A small 2D top-down game where you play **Inca**, a cute yellow dog, navigating a graveyard full of tombs to collect bones. Avoid the skeletons and reach the exit **only after collecting all bones**.

The game mechanics are straightforward, yet they allow for creativity in game design, encouraging students at 42 to design their maps, mecanics, characters, and items.
