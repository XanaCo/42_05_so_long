## Overview

The "so_long" project presents students with the challenge of creating a simple 2D game. Leveraging graphical programming, this project revolves around a character that needs to collect items in a map and then reach the exit, all while trying to minimize the number of moves. This endeavor offers students an introduction to game development and graphical libraries, providing a hands-on experience in creating interactive visual applications.

The game mechanics are straightforward, yet they allow for creativity in game design, encouraging students to design their maps, characters, and items.

## Key Components

1. **Graphical Library**: Using the MiniLibX library, a simple C graphical library frequently used in 42 School projects, to render game elements and handle user inputs.

2. **Game Rendering**: Creating a grid-based game board with distinct tiles for walls, empty spaces, collectible items, the player character, and the exit.

3. **Player Movement**: Implementing player movement mechanics to navigate the map, collecting items, and eventually reaching the exit.

4. **Game Logic**: Ensuring the game follows its rules, such as not allowing the player to pass through walls and triggering game completion once all items are collected, and the player reaches the exit.

5. **Score Counter**: Keeping track of the number of moves made by the player, aiming to complete the game in the fewest steps possible.

6. **Error Handling**: Implementing checks for valid map configurations and other potential game-related errors.

7. **User Interface**: Providing player feedback on move count, game status, and potential win/loss scenarios.

8. **Bonus Features**: Students can enhance their projects with additional features, such as enemies, animations, or varied level designs, to earn bonus points.

## Key Skills Developed

1. **Graphical Programming**: Acquiring experience in rendering 2D graphics and animations using a graphical library.

2. **Game Logic Development**: Implementing core game mechanics, ensuring consistent and bug-free gameplay.

3. **User Input Handling**: Learning to handle and process user inputs in real-time to control game elements.

4. **Problem Solving**: Navigating challenges associated with game development, from ensuring smooth graphics rendering to perfecting game mechanics.

5. **Creativity**: The nature of the project allows students to express creativity in level design, game mechanics, and graphical elements.

6. **Optimization**: As the goal is to finish the game in the least number of moves, students indirectly learn the essence of optimization.

7. **Error Handling**: Developing strategies to manage potential issues, ensuring a seamless user experience.
